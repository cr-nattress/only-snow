## Executive Summary

OnlySnow's sales strategy focuses on three revenue channels: (1) **B2C Premium Subscriptions** via product-led growth with in-app conversion, (2) **B2B Resort Partnerships** via direct enterprise sales to independent ski resorts, and (3) **B2B2C Pass Provider Partnerships** with Epic, Ikon, and Indy Pass for white-label or co-marketing deals. This plan outlines our sales process, target accounts, pricing strategy, and Year 1 revenue targets.

- Premium Subscriptions: $400,000 (5,000 users × $80/year)
- Resort Partnerships: $50,000 (10 partners × $5K/year)
- Affiliate Commissions: $75,000 (500 destination trips × $150 avg commission)

## 1. Sales Strategy Overview

### 1.1 Three-Pronged Approach

| Sales Motion | Target Customer | Sales Process | Revenue Model | Year 1 Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **B2C Self-Service** | Individual skiers | Product-led growth, in-app upsell | $9.99/month or $79/year | $400K (5,000 premium users) |
| **B2B Resort Partnerships** | Independent ski resorts | Direct sales, founder-led | $5K-20K/year partnership fee | $50K (10 partners) |
| **B2B2C Pass Providers** | Epic, Ikon, Indy Pass | Strategic partnerships, licensing | Rev share or licensing fee | $0 in Y1 (pipeline only) |

### 1.2 Sales Philosophy

**Product-Led Growth First**
- OnlySnow is a B2C product that users discover organically or via marketing campaigns
- The product itself is the primary sales tool—users experience value before being asked to pay
- Free tier is generous (forecast data, resort rankings, notifications) to drive adoption
- Premium tier is a natural upgrade for power users (storm chasers, destination travelers)

**B2B Sales as Revenue Accelerator**
- Resort partnerships provide non-dilutive capital and distribution
- Pass provider partnerships create strategic moat (exclusive data access)
- Enterprise sales are founder-led in Year 1, hire BD lead in Year 2

## 2. B2C Premium Subscriptions (Self-Service)

### 2.1 Free vs Premium Feature Matrix

| Feature | Free Tier | Premium Tier |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Functionality** | | |
| Resort rankings (Your Resorts) | ✅ Up to 5 resorts | ✅ Unlimited |
| 10-day snow forecast | ✅ | ✅ |
| Drive time estimates | ✅ | ✅ |
| Resort detail pages | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Discovery & Intelligence** | | |
| Worth Knowing alerts | ⚠️ Local only (1-3 hr drive) | ✅ Regional (up to 6 hr drive) |
| Storm Tracker | ⚠️ Local storms only | ✅ National storm tracking |
| Chase Mode | ❌ | ✅ Full access |
| AI-powered trip planner | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Notifications** | | |
| Powder day alerts | ✅ 1 resort | ✅ All resorts |
| Chase alerts | ❌ | ✅ |
| Road condition alerts | ❌ | ✅ |
| Flight price drop alerts | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Data & Customization** | | |
| Multi-pass support | ❌ 1 pass only | ✅ Unlimited passes |
| Custom personas | ❌ | ✅ Advanced persona tuning |
| Historical snow data | ❌ | ✅ 10-year history |
| Offline maps | ❌ | ✅ |

### 2.2 Pricing Strategy

**Monthly Plan:** $9.99/month
- Target: Casual users who want to "try before they buy"
- Positioned as "less than a latte per month"

**Annual Plan:** $79/year ($6.58/month, save 34%)
- Target: Core users who ski 10+ days/season
- Positioned as "cheaper than one lift ticket"

**Family Plan:** $129/year (up to 4 accounts)
- Target: Family planners coordinating trips
- Positioned as "$2.60/person/month"

**Pricing Rationale:**
- **Competitive Benchmark:** OpenSnow Premium is $99/year; OnlySnow is $79 (20% cheaper)
- **Value-Based Pricing:** If OnlySnow saves 1 hour of trip planning per storm (5 storms/season), that's 5 hours saved. At $50/hr value of time, that's $250 value for $79 price = 3.1x ROI
- **Affordability:** $79 is 5-10% of average season pass cost ($700-1,500), making it a "no-brainer" upsell

### 2.3 Conversion Funnel

**Stage 1: Awareness → Signup**
- Channel: Marketing campaigns, word-of-mouth, App Store
- Conversion target: 20% of website visitors sign up
- Friction: Email/Google OAuth signup (no credit card required)

**Stage 2: Signup → Activation**
- Definition: User completes onboarding (sets location, selects pass, chooses drive radius)
- Conversion target: 80% of signups activate
- Tactics: In-app prompts, onboarding email sequence

**Stage 3: Activation → Engaged User**
- Definition: User opens app 3+ times in first week
- Conversion target: 60% of activated users become engaged
- Tactics: Push notifications (first storm alert), email reminders

**Stage 4: Engaged User → Premium Subscriber**
- Definition: User pays for monthly or annual Premium plan
- Conversion target: 10% of engaged users convert to Premium
- Tactics: In-app paywalls, limited-time offers, feature gating

**Funnel Math (Year 1):**
- Website visitors: 80,000
- Signups (20%): 16,000
- Activated (80%): 12,800
- Engaged (60%): 7,680
- Premium (10%): 768 per month avg → **5,000 annual Premium users**

### 2.4 In-App Conversion Tactics

**Paywall Trigger Points (When to Show Premium Upsell):**

1. **After 3 "Worth Knowing" Dismissals**
   - Message: "You've dismissed 3 opportunities for better snow. Unlock Premium to see regional alerts up to 6 hours away."
   - CTA: "Unlock Regional Discovery"

2. **When User Taps Chase Mode**
   - Message: "Chase Mode is for destination travelers. Get national storm tracking + AI trip planning."
   - CTA: "Unlock Chase Mode – $79/year"

3. **After 5 Powder Day Alerts (Free Tier Gets 1 Resort Only)**
   - Message: "Your other resorts are getting powder too. Unlock alerts for all your resorts."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Premium"

4. **When Storm Severity Reaches "Epic" or "Chase" Level**
   - Message: "This is a chase-worthy storm. Unlock full trip planning to book your trip."
   - CTA: "Get Your Trip Plan – Upgrade Now"

5. **After 30 Days of Active Use (Habit Formation)**
   - Message: "You've checked OnlySnow 20 times this month. Get the most out of it with Premium."
   - CTA: "Upgrade for $6.58/month"

**Paywall Best Practices:**
- **Timing:** Show paywall after user experiences value (not on Day 1)
- **Value Prop:** Show specific benefit user is missing ("Unlock Chase Mode"), not generic "Upgrade"
- **Social Proof:** "Join 2,500+ Premium users who never miss a powder day"
- **Urgency:** "Limited-time offer: Save 50% on your first year" (seasonal sale)

### 2.5 Seasonal Pricing Strategy

**High Season (Nov - Mar): Full Price**
- Pricing: $9.99/month, $79/year
- Rationale: Demand is high, users are actively skiing

**Shoulder Season (Apr - May, Sep - Oct): 25% Off**
- Pricing: $7.49/month, $59/year
- Rationale: Encourage early renewals and off-season retention

**Low Season (Jun - Aug): 50% Off**
- Pricing: $4.99/month, $39/year
- Rationale: Acquire users before high season, build waitlist for next winter

**First-Time User Offer: 7-Day Free Trial**
- Access: Full Premium features for 7 days
- Conversion: Auto-convert to paid after 7 days (opt-out, not opt-in)
- Timing: Offer during onboarding ("Try Premium free for 7 days")

### 2.6 Year 1 B2C Revenue Projections

| Month | New Free Users | Cumulative Free Users | Premium Conversion (10%) | Cumulative Premium Users | MRR (Monthly) | MRR (Annual) | Total MRR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Month 1 | 2,000 | 2,000 | 200 | 200 | $1,998 | $0 | $1,998 |
| Month 2 | 2,500 | 4,500 | 250 | 450 | $4,496 | $0 | $4,496 |
| Month 3 | 3,000 | 7,500 | 300 | 750 | $7,493 | $0 | $7,493 |
| Month 4 | 4,000 | 11,500 | 400 | 1,150 | $11,489 | $0 | $11,489 |
| Month 5 | 5,000 | 16,500 | 500 | 1,650 | $16,484 | $0 | $16,484 |
| Month 6 | 6,000 | 22,500 | 600 | 2,250 | $22,478 | $0 | $22,478 |
| Month 7 | 7,000 | 29,500 | 700 | 2,950 | $29,471 | $0 | $29,471 |
| Month 8 | 8,000 | 37,500 | 800 | 3,750 | $37,463 | $0 | $37,463 |
| Month 9 | 6,000 | 43,500 | 600 | 4,350 | $43,457 | $0 | $43,457 |
| Month 10 | 4,000 | 47,500 | 400 | 4,750 | $47,453 | $0 | $47,453 |
| Month 11 | 2,000 | 49,500 | 200 | 4,950 | $49,450 | $0 | $49,450 |
| Month 12 | 500 | 50,000 | 50 | 5,000 | $49,950 | $0 | $49,950 |

**Assumptions:**
- 50% of users choose annual plan ($79), 50% choose monthly ($9.99)
- Blended MRR per user: $9.99 × 50% + ($79/12) × 50% = $4.99 + $3.29 = **$8.28/user**
- **Year 1 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** 5,000 users × $8.28 × 12 = **$496,800** ≈ **$400,000** (accounting for churn)

---

## 3. B2B Resort Partnerships (Direct Sales)

### 3.1 Target Account Profile

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**
- **Size:** Independent or regional ski resorts (100K-500K annual visitors)
- **Geography:** Western U.S. (CO, UT, WY, ID, MT, NM, CA, OR, WA)
- **Challenge:** Competing with mega-resorts (Vail Resorts, Alterra) for visibility
- **Budget:** Marketing budget $50K-500K/year, willing to spend $5K-20K on partnerships

**Tiering System:**

**Tier 1 (High Priority):** Independent mountains with strong local followings
- Examples: Monarch Mountain, Loveland, Silverton, Bridger Bowl, Taos, Sunlight, Powder Mountain
- Pain Point: "Epic/Ikon resorts get all the visibility, even when we have better snow"
- OnlySnow Value: "Worth Knowing" discovery when they outperform nearby resorts

**Tier 2 (Medium Priority):** Regional darlings with destination appeal
- Examples: Schweitzer, Mt. Bachelor, Purgatory, Big Sky (independent), Crested Butte (before Vail acquisition)
- Pain Point: "We're a hidden gem, but destination travelers default to Vail/Park City"
- OnlySnow Value: National chase alerts + trip planning drive fly-in traffic

**Tier 3 (Lower Priority):** Mega-resorts (Epic/Ikon)
- Examples: Vail, Breckenridge, Park City, Aspen
- Pain Point: "We don't need discovery, but we want first-party data on user behavior"
- OnlySnow Value: Data licensing (how many OnlySnow users visit, where they come from, what they care about)

### 3.2 Partnership Tiers & Pricing

| Tier | Annual Cost | Benefits | Target Resorts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free Tier** | $0 | - Basic listing in OnlySnow database<br>- Forecast data display<br>- Link to resort website | All 500+ resorts |
| **Partner Tier** | $5,000/year | - Enhanced listing (logo, photos, description)<br>- Sponsored "Worth Knowing" placements (when conditions warrant)<br>- Monthly analytics report (# of OnlySnow users who viewed resort) | 50 resorts |
| **Premium Tier** | $20,000/year | - All Partner benefits<br>- Custom landing page in OnlySnow app<br>- First-party data sharing (user demographics, visit intent)<br>- Co-marketing (social media posts, email campaigns)<br>- Priority in Chase Mode alerts | 10 resorts |

**Tier 1: Epic Pass (Vail Resorts)**
- **Pass Holders:** 2.3M
- **Avg Pass Price:** $900
- **Opportunity:** License OnlySnow's recommendation engine for Epic Pass app

**Tier 3: Indy Pass**
- **Pass Holders:** 500K
- **Avg Pass Price:** $300

- **Pitch:** "Help Indy Pass holders maximize their 2-days-per-resort limit by ranking resorts by snow forecast"
- **Revenue Model:** Rev share on Indy Pass sales driven by OnlySnow (5% of $300 = $15 per sale)

### 4.2 Partnership Approach

**Phase 1: Relationship Building (Year 1)**

**Goal:** Get on their radar, build trust

**Tactics:**
1. **Attend industry conferences:** NSAA, SIA Snow Show
2. **Request introductory meetings:** LinkedIn outreach to VP of Digital, VP of Marketing
3. **Offer free value:** "We've analyzed OnlySnow user behavior for Epic Pass holders. Here's what we learned."
4. **Press coverage:** Get featured in Ski Magazine, TechCrunch → Epic/Ikon will notice

**Phase 2: Pilot Program (Year 2)**

**Goal:** Prove value with small pilot

**Tactics:**
1. **API integration:** OnlySnow displays real-time blackout dates, pass benefits from Epic/Ikon API
2. **Co-marketing test:** Epic/Ikon sends one email to 10K pass holders promoting OnlySnow
3. **Attribution tracking:** Measure incremental pass sales, resort visits, user engagement

**Phase 3: Full Partnership (Year 3)**

**Goal:** White-label license or exclusive partnership

**Tactics:**
1. **Licensing deal:** Epic/Ikon licenses OnlySnow's recommendation engine for their app
2. **Acquisition:** Vail Resorts or Alterra acquires OnlySnow outright ($10M-50M exit)

### 4.3 Strategic Value of Pass Partnerships

**Why Epic/Ikon Should Partner:**
1. **Increase pass renewals:** Users who ski more days/season are more likely to renew (OnlySnow drives 2-3 extra ski days per user)
2. **Distribute traffic:** Epic/Ikon want to spread crowds across all resorts, not just Vail/Breckenridge
3. **Data insights:** OnlySnow tracks user behavior (which resorts are preferred, when they ski, what conditions they seek)
4. **Competitive moat:** If Epic partners with OnlySnow exclusively, Ikon pass holders can't access it

**Why OnlySnow Should Partner:**
1. **Distribution:** Instant access to 2.3M Epic Pass holders or 2M Ikon Pass holders
2. **Credibility:** "Official Partner of Epic Pass" badge builds trust
3. **Revenue:** Licensing fees or rev share provide non-dilutive capital
4. **Data access:** API integration with Epic/Ikon's systems (real-time lift status, crowd levels)

## 5. Affiliate Revenue (Passive Income via Product)

### 5.1 Affiliate Partnerships

| Partner | Commission Rate | Avg Transaction | Commission per Booking | Conversion Target | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Flights / Kayak** | $5-15 per booking | $400 RT flight | $10 | 500 bookings | $5,000 |
| **Booking.com / Expedia** | 5-12% of booking | $600 hotel (2 nights) | $48 | 500 bookings | $24,000 |
| **Rental Cars / Turo** | $3-8 per booking | $200 (3-day rental) | $5 | 400 bookings | $2,000 |
| **Liftopia / Ski.com** | $5-10 per ticket | $150 lift ticket | $7.50 | 1,000 bookings | $7,500 |
| **Total Affiliate Revenue** | | | **$70.50 avg** | **2,400 bookings** | **$38,500** |

**Year 1 Affiliate Revenue Target:** $75,000 (assumes higher conversion during peak storm events)

### 5.2 Conversion Optimization

**Strategy 1: Contextual Integration**
- Show "Book flights" CTA only when storm severity is "chase" level
- Pre-populate departure airport, destination airport, dates based on storm forecast
- Example: "Flights from EWR → MTJ $289 (Feb 10-12)" → one-click redirect to Google Flights

**Strategy 2: Price Drop Alerts**
- Track flight prices for upcoming storms
- Send push notification: "Flight prices to Telluride dropped 15% ($289 → $246). Book now?"
- Creates urgency and increases conversion

**Strategy 3: Complete Trip Bundles**
- Show total trip cost (flights + lodging + rental car + lift tickets)
- Example: "Your Telluride chase trip: $1,746 total. Book now?"
- One-tap booking flow reduces friction

**Strategy 4: Social Proof**
- "128 OnlySnow users booked trips to Telluride this week"
- Creates FOMO and validates the decision

### 6.3 Sales Playbook

**Discovery Call Script:**

```
[Opening]
Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time to chat. I'm [Your Name], founder of OnlySnow. We've built a ski decision engine that helps skiers figure out where to ski based on snow forecasts, and we're partnering with resorts like yours to solve the discovery problem.

Before I dive into OnlySnow, I'd love to learn more about [Resort Name]. Can you tell me a bit about your biggest challenges when it comes to attracting new visitors?

[Listen, take notes]

[Transition]
That makes sense. The good news is that OnlySnow is uniquely positioned to solve that. Here's how it works...

[Demo]
[Share screen, show OnlySnow app]

This is the dashboard. Users see their pass resorts ranked by snow forecast. But here's the magic: When a resort NOT on their list—like yours—has significantly better conditions, we surface it in the "Worth Knowing" section.

For example, during the Feb 10 storm, [Your Resort] got 18 inches while nearby Epic resorts got 8-10. We alerted 5,000 OnlySnow users, and 500 of them clicked through to your website. That's discovery you wouldn't have gotten otherwise.

[Value Prop]
The way we see it, [Resort Name] has three options:
1. Keep relying on Google search and hope skiers find you
2. Spend $50K on Facebook ads competing with Vail Resorts
3. Partner with OnlySnow for $5K/year and get targeted exposure to powder-hungry skiers exactly when you have the best conditions

Which sounds most appealing?

[Qualification]
A few questions to make sure this is a good fit:
- What's your budget for partnerships like this?
- Who else needs to be involved in this decision?
- What's your timeline? We're onboarding partners now for the upcoming season.

[Close]
Great. Here's what I'll do: I'll send over a partnership proposal with pricing and expected ROI. Let's schedule a follow-up next week to go through it together. Sound good?

[Send calendar invite for follow-up]

## Appendix A: Sales Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Outreach to Resort Marketing Director

**Subject:** Help [Resort Name] Get Discovered by 50K Powder-Hungry Skiers

```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of OnlySnow—a ski decision engine that helps skiers figure out where to ski based on real-time snow forecasts.

Here's the problem we're solving: When [Resort Name] gets 18 inches and nearby Epic resorts get 8-10, most skiers don't know. They check Vail's forecast, see "good enough," and ski there—even though YOU have the better conditions.

OnlySnow fixes this. We monitor ALL resorts in a user's region and surface the best snow—including resorts they don't follow. During the Feb 10 storm, we alerted 5,000 skiers that [nearby independent resort] had the best snow in Colorado. That's discovery you can't buy with Facebook ads.

I'd love to show you how [Resort Name] could benefit from a partnership.

Are you open to a 15-min call this week?

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, OnlySnow
[calendly link]

I'm happy to walk through this in detail on a follow-up call. Let me know what questions you have.

Are you available [day/time] to discuss next steps?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Closing Email

**Subject:** Let's Make This Official – [Resort Name] x OnlySnow

```
Hi [Name],

Exciting to move forward with the partnership! Here's what I need from your side to get [Resort Name] live in OnlySnow:

1. **Contract signature:** [DocuSign link]
2. **Payment:** $5,000 annual partnership fee [Stripe invoice link]
3. **Assets:** High-res logo, 3-5 resort photos, 100-word description

Once I receive these, we'll have you live in OnlySnow within 2 weeks. I'll also schedule a kick-off call to walk through the analytics dashboard and co-marketing plan.

Looking forward to a great partnership.

Best,
