# OnlySnow Monetization Plan

**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

OnlySnow operates a **diversified monetization model** combining B2C subscriptions, B2B partnerships, affiliate commissions, and data licensing. This plan outlines our path to $525K in Year 1, $2.5M in Year 3, and $10M+ in Year 5 through a multi-revenue stream approach that reduces dependency on any single channel.

**Core Monetization Philosophy:** Monetize value, not data. Users pay for intelligent recommendations, resorts pay for discovery, and we earn commissions by facilitating bookings—never by selling personal data.

## 1. Revenue Model Overview

### 1.1 Five Revenue Streams

| Revenue Stream | Description | Year 1 Revenue | Year 3 Revenue | Year 5 Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. B2C Premium Subscriptions** | Monthly/annual plans for power users | $400,000 | $1,600,000 | $4,000,000 |
| **2. B2B Resort Partnerships** | Partnership fees from ski resorts | $50,000 | $300,000 | $800,000 |
| **3. Affiliate Commissions** | Commissions on travel bookings | $75,000 | $400,000 | $2,000,000 |
| **4. Data Licensing (Future)** | First-party data to resorts, pass providers | $0 | $200,000 | $2,000,000 |
| **5. Advertising (Future)** | Sponsored placements, native ads | $0 | $0 | $1,200,000 |
| **Total Annual Revenue** | | **$525,000** | **$2,500,000** | **$10,000,000** |

### 1.2 Revenue Diversification Strategy

**Why Diversification Matters:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** If Premium subscriptions underperform, affiliate revenue can compensate
- **Market Coverage:** Different personas monetize differently (storm chasers → affiliates, weekend warriors → subscriptions)
- **Strategic Optionality:** Multiple revenue streams create M&A optionality (Vail Resorts may acquire for data, Booking.com may acquire for bookings)

**Revenue Mix Evolution:**

| Year | Subscriptions | Partnerships | Affiliates | Data | Advertising |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 76% | 10% | 14% | 0% | 0% |
| Year 3 | 64% | 12% | 16% | 8% | 0% |
| Year 5 | 40% | 8% | 20% | 20% | 12% |

**Strategic Insight:** Subscriptions drive early revenue and cash flow. Affiliates scale with user growth. Data licensing becomes the highest-margin stream by Year 5.

## 2. B2C Premium Subscriptions

### 2.1 Pricing Strategy

**Pricing Tiers:**

| Plan | Price | Target Persona | Value Proposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | Weekend Warriors, Casual Users | Basic forecasts, 5 resort limit, local alerts only |
| **Monthly** | $9.99/month | Trial users, seasonal skiers | All features, cancel anytime |
| **Annual** | $79/year ($6.58/month) | Core users, storm chasers | Save 34%, best value |
| **Family** | $129/year (4 accounts) | Family Planners | $2.60/person/month, shared preferences |

**Pricing Psychology:**
- **Anchoring:** Annual plan is "less than one lift ticket" ($79 < $150 avg day pass)
- **Decoy Effect:** Monthly plan ($9.99 × 12 = $119.88) makes annual plan ($79) look like a steal
- **Social Proof:** "Join 5,000+ Premium users who never miss a powder day"

### 2.2 Conversion Funnel Economics

**Funnel Metrics (Year 1):**

| Stage | Users | Conversion Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Website Visitors | 80,000 | — | From marketing campaigns |
| Signups | 16,000 | 20% | Email or Google OAuth |
| Activated Users | 12,800 | 80% | Complete onboarding |
| Engaged Users | 7,680 | 60% | 3+ sessions in first week |
| **Premium Subscribers** | **768/month avg** | **10%** | **5,000 annual total** |

**Unit Economics:**

| Metric | Value | Calculation |
|---|---|---|
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | $6.70 | $120K marketing spend / 18,500 paid-acquired users |
| Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) | $8.28/month | 50% annual ($79/12) + 50% monthly ($9.99) |
| Gross Margin | 95% | SaaS economics (minimal COGS) |
| Customer Lifetime (avg) | 18 months | Seasonal product, some churn in off-season |
| Lifetime Value (LTV) | $142 | $8.28 × 18 months × 95% margin |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | **21:1** | $142 / $6.70 (healthy SaaS benchmark: 3:1) |

**Key Insight:** Even with conservative 10% conversion, OnlySnow has exceptional unit economics due to low CAC (product-led growth, word-of-mouth) and high LTV (strong retention among engaged users).

### 2.3 Feature Gating Strategy

**Free Tier (Generous to Drive Adoption):**
- ✅ Resort rankings (up to 5 resorts)
- ✅ 10-day snow forecast
- ✅ Drive time estimates
- ✅ Resort detail pages
- ✅ 1 powder day alert per storm

**Premium Tier (Unlock When Value is Proven):**
- ✅ Unlimited resorts
- ✅ National storm tracking (Chase Mode)
- ✅ AI-powered trip planner
- ✅ Multi-pass support (Epic + Ikon + Indy)
- ✅ Unlimited powder day alerts
- ✅ Flight + lodging price tracking
- ✅ Historical snow data (10-year archive)
- ✅ Offline maps

**Paywall Triggers (When to Show Upgrade Prompt):**
1. **After user taps Chase Mode** → "Unlock national storm tracking for $79/year"
2. **After 3 'Worth Knowing' dismissals** → "You're missing opportunities. Upgrade for regional alerts."
3. **After 5 powder alerts (free tier limit)** → "Get alerts for ALL your resorts, not just one."
4. **After 30 days of active use** → "You've checked OnlySnow 20 times. Unlock the full experience."
5. **When major storm is incoming** → "This is a chase-worthy storm. Unlock trip planning."

### 2.4 Retention & Churn Optimization

**Monthly Churn Target:** 5% (annual churn: ~50%)

**Retention Tactics:**

**1. Seasonal Engagement Patterns**
- Challenge: Skiing is seasonal (Nov-Mar peak, Jun-Aug dead)
- Solution: Off-season content (summer glacier skiing, Southern Hemisphere trips, gear reviews)

**2. Habit Formation**
- Goal: Get users to check OnlySnow 3+ times per week
- Tactics: Push notifications (daily forecast, storm alerts), email digests (weekly outlook)

**3. Commitment Devices**
- Annual plan users have lower churn (sunk cost fallacy + forgot to cancel)
- Offer: "Upgrade to annual, save 34%, lock in this season's pricing"

**4. Win-Back Campaigns**
- Trigger: User cancels Premium or goes 30+ days inactive
- Email: "We miss you. Here's 50% off to come back" + "New features since you left"

**5. Community Building**
- Discord server for Premium users (exclusive channel)
- Monthly "Storm Briefing" webinars with meteorologist
- Ambassador program (50 power users get lifetime free Premium)

### 2.5 Year 1-5 Subscription Revenue Projections

| Year | Total Users | Premium Users | Premium % | Avg Price | Annual Subscription Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1** | 50,000 | 5,000 | 10% | $80 | $400,000 |
| **Year 2** | 150,000 | 18,000 | 12% | $85 | $1,530,000 |
| **Year 3** | 300,000 | 40,000 | 13% | $90 | $3,600,000 |
| **Year 4** | 500,000 | 75,000 | 15% | $95 | $7,125,000 |
| **Year 5** | 750,000 | 120,000 | 16% | $99 | $11,880,000 |

**Assumptions:**
- Premium conversion increases over time (10% → 16%) due to product improvements and network effects
- Avg price increases 5-10% per year (inflation + value creation)
- User growth driven by marketing, word-of-mouth, and geographic expansion

## 3. B2B Resort Partnerships

### 3.1 Partnership Tiers & Pricing

| Tier | Annual Fee | Target Resorts | Benefits | Year 1 Goal | Year 3 Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | $0 | All 500+ resorts | Basic listing, forecast display | 500 | 600 |
| **Partner** | $5,000/year | Independent mountains | Enhanced listing, "Worth Knowing" placements, analytics | 10 | 40 |
| **Premium** | $20,000/year | Destination resorts | Custom landing page, first-party data, co-marketing | 0 | 10 |
| **Enterprise** | $50,000+/year | Resort groups (future) | White-label OnlySnow for resort's app, full API access | 0 | 2 |

### 3.2 Value Proposition to Resorts

**Problem Resorts Face:**
- Independent mountains struggle to compete with Epic/Ikon resorts for visibility
- $50K-500K annual marketing budgets, but Facebook/Google ads are expensive and untargeted
- Destination travelers default to "brand name" resorts (Vail, Breckenridge, Park City)

**OnlySnow's Solution:**
- **Precision targeting:** OnlySnow only surfaces your resort when YOU have the best conditions
- **Intent-based discovery:** Users see your resort when they're actively deciding where to ski (high intent)
- **Attribution:** Track how many OnlySnow users visit your resort (QR code check-ins, promo codes)

**ROI Example (Conservative):**
- Partnership cost: $5,000/year
- OnlySnow users who view resort via "Worth Knowing": 5,000
- Click-through to website: 500 (10% CTR)
- Visitors to resort: 50 (10% conversion)
- Avg spend per visitor: $150 (lift ticket + parking + food)
- Incremental revenue: $7,500
- **ROI: 150%** ($7,500 revenue / $5,000 cost)

### 3.3 Revenue Projections

| Year | Partner Tier ($5K) | Premium Tier ($20K) | Enterprise Tier ($50K+) | Total Partnership Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1** | 10 partners = $50,000 | 0 | 0 | $50,000 |
| **Year 2** | 30 partners = $150,000 | 5 partners = $100,000 | 0 | $250,000 |
| **Year 3** | 40 partners = $200,000 | 10 partners = $200,000 | 2 partners = $100,000 | $500,000 |
| **Year 4** | 50 partners = $250,000 | 15 partners = $300,000 | 5 partners = $250,000 | $800,000 |
| **Year 5** | 60 partners = $300,000 | 20 partners = $400,000 | 10 partners = $500,000 | $1,200,000 |

**Strategic Insight:** Partnership revenue scales slower than subscription revenue but has higher gross margin (80-90%) since OnlySnow already surfaces all resorts for free. Partnerships just unlock premium placements and data.

## 4. Affiliate Commissions

### 4.1 Affiliate Partnership Matrix

| Partner Category | Partners | Commission Structure | Avg Transaction | Commission per Booking | Conversion Target | Year 1 Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Lessons** | Ski.com, resort direct | $10-15 per booking | $200 group lesson | $12 | 100 bookings | $1,200 |
| **Travel Insurance** | World Nomads, Allianz | $20-40 per policy | $100 policy | $30 | 50 policies | $1,500 |
| **Total** | | | | **$122.50 avg** | **2,750 bookings** | **$43,200** |

**Year 1 Affiliate Revenue Target:** $75,000 (assumes higher conversion during peak storm events + some high-value bookings)

### 4.2 Conversion Funnel Optimization

**Current Booking Flow (Friction):**
1. User sees storm alert in OnlySnow
2. Manually searches Google Flights for flights
3. Manually searches Booking.com for hotels
4. Manually searches Kayak for rental cars
5. Manually searches Liftopia for lift tickets
6. **Total time: 30-60 minutes, high abandonment**

**OnlySnow Integrated Booking Flow (Frictionless):**
1. User sees storm alert + trip plan in OnlySnow
2. Taps "Book This Trip" → sees pre-populated itinerary:
   - Flight: EWR → MTJ, $289 (Kayak affiliate link)
   - Hotel: Telluride Lodge, $195/night (Booking.com affiliate link)
   - Rental Car: AWD from Montrose, $55/day (Kayak affiliate link)
   - Lift Tickets: 3-day pass, $169/day (Liftopia affiliate link)
3. One-tap booking for each component
4. **Total time: 5 minutes, low abandonment**

**Conversion Rate Targets:**

| Booking Type | Baseline Conversion (Manual) | OnlySnow Conversion (Integrated) | Lift from Integration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flights | 2% | 5% | 2.5x |
| Lodging | 3% | 8% | 2.7x |
| Rental Cars | 2% | 6% | 3x |
| Lift Tickets | 5% | 12% | 2.4x |

**Key Insight:** Reducing friction from 30 minutes (manual) to 5 minutes (integrated) can 2-3x conversion rates, driving affiliate revenue.

### 4.3 High-Value Booking Strategies

**1. Dynamic Pricing & Urgency**
- Track flight prices in real-time
- Alert users: "Flight prices to Telluride up 15% in 24 hrs. Book now?"
- Create urgency → higher conversion

**2. Package Bundling**
- Show total trip cost: "Your Telluride chase: $1,746 (flights + hotel + car + tickets)"
- Users more likely to book "complete trip" vs piecemeal

**3. Social Proof**
- "128 OnlySnow users booked trips to Telluride this week"
- Creates FOMO, validates decision

**4. Personalized Recommendations**
- Learn user preferences (budget, lodging style, airport)
- Pre-fill trip plan with personalized options
- Example: Storm Chaser persona → show fastest flights, budget lodging, 3-day lift pass

### 4.4 Affiliate Revenue Scaling (Year 1-5)

| Year | Premium Users | % Who Book Trips | Avg Trips per User | Total Trips | Avg Commission | Affiliate Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Year 1** | 5,000 | 10% | 1 | 500 | $150 | $75,000 |
| **Year 2** | 18,000 | 12% | 1.2 | 2,592 | $160 | $414,720 |
| **Year 3** | 40,000 | 15% | 1.5 | 9,000 | $170 | $1,530,000 |
| **Year 4** | 75,000 | 18% | 1.8 | 24,300 | $180 | $4,374,000 |
| **Year 5** | 120,000 | 20% | 2 | 48,000 | $190 | $9,120,000 |

**Assumptions:**
- Booking rate increases as trip planning features improve (10% → 20%)
- Trips per user increase as users trust OnlySnow's recommendations (1 → 2 trips/year)
- Avg commission increases as OnlySnow negotiates better rates with partners ($150 → $190)

**Strategic Insight:** Affiliate revenue can scale to 40-50% of total revenue by Year 5, making it the largest revenue stream. This creates strategic value for potential acquirers (Booking.com, Expedia, Kayak).

## 5. Data Licensing (Future Revenue Stream)

### 5.1 First-Party Data Assets

**Data OnlySnow Collects:**
1. **User Preferences**
   - Home location, airports, drive radius
   - Pass type (Epic, Ikon, Indy), number of days skied/season
   - Persona (storm chaser, family planner, weekend warrior)
   - Skill level, group type, budget

2. **Behavioral Data**
   - Which resorts users tap on (interest signal)
   - Which "Worth Knowing" alerts they act on (discovery signal)
   - Which storms trigger trip planning (chase-worthiness threshold)
   - Booking patterns (how far in advance, price sensitivity)

3. **Predictive Insights**
   - User lifetime value (LTV) prediction
   - Churn risk scoring
   - Persona classification accuracy
   - Storm impact modeling (how much snow drives how many visits)

### 5.2 Data Licensing Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Resort Marketing Optimization**
- **Who Buys:** Ski resorts (independent mountains, destination resorts)
- **What They Get:** Anonymous aggregated data on OnlySnow users who expressed interest in their resort
- **Example Insights:**
  - "40% of OnlySnow users interested in your resort are Epic Pass holders from Denver (1.5 hr drive)"
  - "Users visit your resort when snowfall exceeds 10 inches in 24 hours"
  - "Top competitor resorts: Loveland (20% overlap), Copper (15% overlap)"
- **Pricing:** $10K-50K per resort per year
- **Revenue Potential (Year 3):** 20 resorts × $10K avg = $200,000

**Use Case 2: Pass Provider Insights**
- **Who Buys:** Epic, Ikon, Indy Pass
- **What They Get:** Insights to optimize pass pricing, blackout dates, resort mix
- **Example Insights:**
  - "Epic Pass holders ski 12 days/season on average, but 'storm chasers' ski 18 days"
  - "Ikon Pass holders visit Steamboat 2.5x more than Mammoth (reallocate marketing budget)"
  - "Indy Pass holders value 'hidden gems' discovery (lean into underdog positioning)"
- **Pricing:** $100K-500K per pass provider per year
- **Revenue Potential (Year 5):** 3 pass providers × $200K avg = $600,000

**Use Case 3: Travel Industry Insights**
- **Who Buys:** Airlines, OTAs (Online Travel Agencies), destination marketing orgs
- **What They Get:** Predictive demand forecasting for ski travel
- **Example Insights:**
  - "United Airlines: EWR → DEN flights will see 20% demand spike Feb 10-12 (major storm incoming)"
  - "Booking.com: Telluride hotel demand will surge for Feb 10 check-in (chase-worthy storm)"
  - "Visit Colorado: OnlySnow users from NYC are 3x more likely to book trips than users from LA"
- **Pricing:** $50K-200K per partner per year
- **Revenue Potential (Year 5):** 10 partners × $100K avg = $1,000,000

### 5.3 Data Licensing Revenue Projections

| Year | Resorts | Pass Providers | Travel Partners | Total Data Licensing Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | $0 |
| Year 2 | 5 × $10K = $50K | 0 | 0 | $50,000 |
| Year 3 | 20 × $10K = $200K | 1 × $100K = $100K | 2 × $50K = $100K | $400,000 |
| Year 4 | 30 × $15K = $450K | 2 × $200K = $400K | 5 × $100K = $500K | $1,350,000 |
| Year 5 | 40 × $20K = $800K | 3 × $300K = $900K | 10 × $150K = $1,500K | $3,200,000 |

**Key Insight:** Data licensing becomes the highest-margin revenue stream (90-95% gross margin, zero incremental COGS) by Year 5. This is the "moat" that makes OnlySnow defensible against competitors.

## 6. Advertising (Future Revenue Stream)

### 6.1 Advertising Principles

**OnlySnow's Advertising Philosophy:**
- **Native, not intrusive:** Ads must blend into the product (sponsored "Worth Knowing" placements, not banner ads)
- **Contextually relevant:** Only show ads related to skiing (gear, resorts, travel)
- **Value-add, not annoyance:** Ads should provide value (e.g., "Loveland is offering 20% off lift tickets today")

**Ad Formats:**

| Format | Placement | Pricing | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sponsored "Worth Knowing"** | Discovery section | $5-10 CPM | "Loveland got 10" today—20% off lift tickets with code POWDER20" |
| **Sponsored Storm Alerts** | Push notifications | $2-5 per send | "Major storm incoming to CO. Save 20% on rentals at REI." |
| **Sponsored Trip Plans** | Chase Mode | $50-100 per placement | "Book your Telluride trip with Ski.com—save 15% on packages" |
| **Display Ads** | Resort detail pages | $3-7 CPM | Gear brand ads on resort pages |

### 6.2 Advertising Revenue Potential

**Year 5 Projections (When User Base is Large Enough):**

| Ad Format | Impressions/Month | CPM | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sponsored "Worth Knowing" | 500,000 | $8 | $4,000 | $48,000 |
| Sponsored Storm Alerts | 100,000 sends | $3 per send | $300,000 | $3,600,000 |
| Sponsored Trip Plans | 10,000 views | $75 per placement | $750,000 | $9,000,000 |
| Display Ads | 1,000,000 | $5 | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| **Total** | | | **$1,059,000/month** | **$12,708,000/year** |

**Conservative Year 5 Target:** $1,200,000 (assumes lower fill rates, seasonal fluctuations)

**Key Insight:** Advertising becomes significant only when OnlySnow has 500K+ users and strong engagement (10M+ monthly impressions). Focus on subscriptions, partnerships, and affiliates first.

## 7. Pricing Optimization & Experiments

### 7.1 Pricing Test Matrix (Year 1-2)

| Test | Hypothesis | Methodology | Success Metric |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Annual vs Monthly Pricing** | Lower monthly price ($7.99) increases monthly sign-ups but annual plan has better LTV | A/B test: $9.99/month vs $7.99/month | Which drives higher LTV? |
| **Seasonal Pricing** | 50% off in summer drives off-season retention | Offer $39/year (Jun-Aug) vs $79 (Nov-Mar) | Do summer subscribers renew in Nov? |
| **First-Time User Discount** | "50% off first year" increases conversions | Show discount to new users only | Conversion rate increase vs control |
| **Family Plan Adoption** | $129 family plan (4 accounts) increases ARPU | Promote family plan to users who ski with family | % of users who upgrade to family plan |
| **Freemium Feature Gating** | Unlock Chase Mode only for Premium increases urgency | A: Chase Mode free, B: Chase Mode Premium-only | Premium conversion rate A vs B |

### 7.2 Dynamic Pricing Strategy

**Concept:** Adjust pricing based on real-time demand

**Implementation:**
- **Storm-triggered pricing:** When major storm is incoming, show "Upgrade now to unlock trip planning for this chase"
- **Urgency discounts:** "Limited-time offer: Save 50% on Premium (expires in 24 hrs)"
- **Personalized pricing:** Show lower price to price-sensitive personas, full price to luxury seekers

**Example:**
- Base price: $79/year
- Storm Chaser persona during major storm: $99/year (premium pricing, high willingness to pay)
- Casual User persona in off-season: $49/year (discount pricing to drive conversion)

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Avoid "surge pricing" perception (users hate feeling gouged)
- Frame dynamic pricing as "seasonal sales" or "limited-time offers"
- Always show "original price" with strikethrough to create value perception

## 8. Unit Economics Deep Dive

### 8.1 B2C Premium Subscription Unit Economics

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Industry Benchmark |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | $6.70 | $12.00 | $20.00 | $50-100 (SaaS) |
| **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** | $8.28/month | $9.50/month | $11.00/month | $10-50 (consumer SaaS) |
| **Gross Margin** | 95% | 95% | 93% | 70-90% (SaaS) |
| **Monthly Churn Rate** | 5% | 4% | 3% | 5-7% (consumer SaaS) |
| **Customer Lifetime (months)** | 18 | 24 | 30 | 12-36 (seasonal SaaS) |
| **Lifetime Value (LTV)** | $142 | $217 | $308 | $100-500 |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 21:1 | 18:1 | 15:1 | 3:1 (healthy SaaS) |
| **Months to Recover CAC** | 0.8 | 1.3 | 1.8 | 6-12 (SaaS) |

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Best-in-class LTV:CAC:** OnlySnow's 21:1 ratio (Year 1) is exceptional due to product-led growth and word-of-mouth
- **Fast payback:** CAC recovered in <1 month (vs 6-12 months typical for SaaS) means cash-efficient growth
- **Seasonal challenge:** Churn is higher than B2B SaaS (5% vs 2-3%) due to seasonality, but LTV is still strong

### 8.2 B2B Resort Partnership Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Sales Cycle** | 90 days (first deal), 30 days (renewals) |
| **Win Rate** | 20% (1 in 5 prospects close) |
| **Average Contract Value (ACV)** | $5,000 (Partner Tier) |
| **Gross Margin** | 85% (minimal COGS, just sales + support time) |
| **Renewal Rate** | 80% (high retention due to ROI proof) |
| **CAC (Sales Time)** | $500 (10 hrs founder time @ $50/hr) |
| **LTV** | $16,667 (5 years × $5K × 80% retention ^ 4 years) |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 33:1 (exceptional) |

**Key Takeaway:** B2B partnerships have higher LTV:CAC than subscriptions due to long sales cycles (90 days) amortized over multi-year relationships.

### 8.3 Affiliate Booking Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Cost per Trip Plan Generated** | $0 (built into product) |
| **Conversion: Trip Plan → Booking** | 5% |
| **Average Commission per Booking** | $150 |
| **Gross Margin** | 100% (pure commission, no COGS) |
| **CAC** | $0 (organic product usage) |
| **LTV** | ∞ (no customer acquisition cost, scales with usage) |

**Key Takeaway:** Affiliate revenue has infinite LTV:CAC ratio (zero CAC, pure upside). This is the "holy grail" of monetization—OnlySnow facilitates bookings as a byproduct of the core product.

## 11. Monetization Experiments & Optimizations

### 11.1 Year 1 Experiments

| Experiment | Goal | Methodology | Success Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Premium Paywall Timing** | Maximize conversion without annoying users | A/B test: Show paywall after 3 vs 7 vs 14 days | Highest conversion rate + lowest churn |
| **Free Tier Generosity** | Find optimal free tier feature set | A/B test: 5 resorts vs unlimited, 1 alert vs 3 alerts | Highest Premium conversion rate |
| **Annual vs Monthly Preference** | Understand user payment preferences | Track % who choose annual vs monthly | Optimize pricing page to nudge toward annual |
| **Seasonal Pricing** | Test price sensitivity in off-season | Offer 50% off (Jun-Aug), measure uptake | Conversion rate vs full-price baseline |
| **Affiliate Conversion** | Optimize booking flow UX | A/B test: "Book Now" vs "View Flights" CTA | Booking completion rate |

### 11.2 Year 2-3 Optimizations

**1. Persona-Based Pricing**
- Hypothesis: Storm Chasers have 3x higher WTP (willingness to pay) than Weekend Warriors
- Test: Show $99/year to Storm Chasers, $69/year to Weekend Warriors (dynamically based on onboarding signals)
- Expected Impact: +15% revenue per user without decreasing conversion

**2. Usage-Based Pricing (Alternative Model)**
- Concept: Charge per trip plan generated ($10/trip) instead of monthly subscription
- Target: Infrequent users (1-2 trips/year) who don't want to pay $79/year
- Revenue Model: 10,000 users × 1.5 trips × $10 = $150K incremental revenue

**3. Tiered Premium Plans**
- **Premium Lite:** $49/year → Chase Mode, multi-pass, unlimited resorts (no trip planning)
- **Premium Pro:** $99/year → All Lite features + AI trip planning + flight price alerts
- Goal: Capture price-sensitive users with Lite, upsell to Pro over time

**4. B2B White-Label Licensing**
- Concept: License OnlySnow's recommendation engine to Epic/Ikon for $500K-1M/year
- Tradeoff: Revenue upside vs potential cannibalization of B2C users
- Decision: Only license if Epic/Ikon drives incremental users (not cannibalizes existing)

---

## 12. Strategic Monetization Trade-offs

### 12.1 Advertising vs Subscription Purity

**Dilemma:** Should OnlySnow introduce ads to free users or keep the product ad-free?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Ad-Free (Current)** | - Clean UX, strong brand perception<br>- Higher Premium conversion (no free alternative) | - Leaves revenue on the table (could monetize free users via ads) |
| **Ads in Free Tier** | - Monetize free users ($5-10/user/year)<br>- Creates "upgrade to remove ads" motivation | - Degrades UX, risks user churn<br>- Conflicts with "authentic" brand positioning |

**Recommendation:** Stay ad-free in Year 1-2 to build brand loyalty. Introduce **native, non-intrusive ads** (sponsored "Worth Knowing" placements) in Year 3+ only if subscription revenue underperforms.

### 12.2 Data Privacy vs Data Licensing

**Dilemma:** OnlySnow collects valuable behavioral data (which resorts users tap, booking patterns). Should we license this data?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **No Data Licensing** | - Maintains user trust<br>- Aligns with "don't sell data" ethos | - Misses high-margin revenue stream ($200K-3M/year) |
| **Anonymized Data Licensing** | - High-margin revenue (90%+)<br>- Helps resorts optimize marketing | - Risk of user backlash if not communicated transparently |

**Recommendation:** License **anonymized, aggregated data only** (never individual user data). Communicate clearly: "We share insights like '40% of users interested in your resort are Epic Pass holders from Denver' — never 'John Smith from Denver searched for your resort.'"

### 12.3 Affiliate Revenue vs Direct Booking

**Dilemma:** Should OnlySnow take affiliate commissions (5-12%) or build a direct booking platform (20-30% take rate)?

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Affiliate Model (Current)** | - No booking liability (cancellations, refunds)<br>- Fast to implement (just links) | - Lower margins (5-12% vs 20-30%)<br>- Dependent on partners (Booking.com, Kayak) |
| **Direct Booking Platform** | - Higher margins (20-30% take rate)<br>- Full control over UX | - Requires payment processing, customer support, refund handling<br>- Complex regulatory compliance (travel industry) |

**Recommendation:** Start with **affiliate model** (low risk, fast iteration). Build **direct booking platform in Year 3-4** once OnlySnow has scale (100K+ users) and leverage to negotiate with suppliers.

## 13. Competitive Monetization Analysis

### 13.1 How Competitors Monetize

| Competitor | Pricing | Revenue Model | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenSnow** | $50-100/year | Subscriptions (100%) | - Strong brand trust<br>- High retention | - Single revenue stream<br>- No affiliate or partnership revenue |
| **OnTheSnow** | Free | Advertising + resort partnerships | - Massive reach (2M users)<br>- Diversified revenue | - Ads degrade UX<br>- No Premium tier (no MRR) |
| **AllTrails** | $36-80/year | Freemium subscriptions (90%+) | - High conversion (11%)<br>- Strong retention | - No affiliate revenue (missed opportunity) |
| **Hopper** | Free | Fintech fees (50%) + affiliate (50%) | - Innovative "Price Freeze" monetization<br>- High ARPU ($20/user/year) | - Complex regulatory (fintech)<br>- Requires scale |
| **Strava** | $80/year | Subscriptions (95%) | - Network effects<br>- Community moat | - Low conversion (2%)<br>- High churn (seasonal athletes) |

### 13.2 OnlySnow's Monetization Advantages

## Appendix A: Monetization FAQ

**Q: Why not just charge resorts for listings (like Yelp)?**
A: Resorts already have free listings. OnlySnow monetizes premium placements (sponsored "Worth Knowing") and first-party data insights, not basic listings.

**Q: Why not build a direct booking platform instead of using affiliates?**
A: Direct booking requires payment processing, customer support, refund handling, and regulatory compliance. Affiliates let us monetize bookings with zero liability. We may build direct booking in Year 3-4 once we have scale.

**Q: How do you prevent users from using OnlySnow to research, then booking directly (avoiding affiliate commissions)?**
A: We can't (and shouldn't) prevent this. The value is in frictionless booking—if we make it easier to book via OnlySnow than manually searching 5 sites, users will use our links. Conversion optimization is key.

**Q: Won't Epic/Ikon just copy OnlySnow and kill you?**
A: Possible, but unlikely. Epic/Ikon are resort operators first, tech companies second. They're slow to innovate on digital products. OnlySnow's moat is behavioral data (user preferences, tap patterns) that improves recommendations over time—hard to replicate. Also, OnlySnow works across Epic + Ikon + Indy, while Epic/Ikon apps are siloed.

**Q: What if OpenSnow adds recommendations and trip planning?**
A: They could, but their brand is "trusted forecast data," not "decision engine." Adding recommendations may dilute their positioning. Also, OpenSnow is bootstrapped (no VC funding), so they move slower than venture-backed competitors.

**Q: How do you plan to monetize in off-season (Jun-Aug)?**
A: Southern Hemisphere skiing (Chile, Argentina, New Zealand), summer glacier skiing (Timberline Lodge, A-Basin), and off-season trip planning ("Book your Jan trip now"). Also, offer 50% off subscriptions in summer to retain users.
