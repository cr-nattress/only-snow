## 1. Market Analysis

### 1.1 Market Size & Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
- 10M+ active skiers/snowboarders in North America
- $450M ski app market in 2024 → $1.2B projected by 2033 (12.2% CAGR)
- 8.9M skier visits in Colorado alone (2023-2024 season)
- Average destination trip spend: $1,500-3,000 per trip

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**
- 6M pass holders (Epic: 2.3M, Ikon: 2M, Indy: 500K, regional passes: 1.2M)
- 3M destination travelers (fly-in trips 2-5x per season)
- 4M weekend warriors (local day-trippers with flexible schedules)

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM - Year 1):**
- 50,000 users (0.5% of pass holders)
- Focus: Colorado Front Range + Salt Lake City corridor + Pacific Northwest

### 1.2 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Strength | Weakness | OnlySnow's Edge |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OpenSnow** ($50-100/yr, 500K+ users) | Best snow forecast data, trusted brand | No ranking, no trip planning, data-only | Interpretation + recommendations + logistics |
| **OnTheSnow** (Free, 2M+ resorts) | Massive resort coverage, webcams | No personalization, generic | Pass-aware, location-based auto-population |
| **Epic/Ikon Apps** | Owned pass audience | No cross-pass comparison, no weather intelligence | Multi-pass support, storm-triggered trip planning |
| **Liftopia** | Discount lift tickets (up to 80% off) | No forecasting, booking-focused | Weather intelligence → booking conversion |
| **Ski.com / Epic.com** | Package deals with flights + lodging | No real-time storm tracking | Storm alerts → instant trip planning |

**Key Insight:** All pieces exist in silos. No one connects snow forecasting + pass awareness + trip logistics + personalization into one decision engine.

1. **Storm Chaser (30% of market, highest LTV)** — 10-20 days/season, 5-10 fly-out trips

## 2. Marketing Strategy

### 2.1 Brand Positioning

**Brand Promise:** OnlySnow tells you where to ski and when, so you can stop researching and start shredding.

**Brand Pillars:**
1. **Intelligent** — AI-powered recommendations, not just data dumps
2. **Personalized** — Pass-aware, location-based, learns your preferences
3. **Actionable** — From forecast to booked trip in minutes, not hours
4. **Authentic** — Built by skiers for skiers, not a corporate weather app

**Brand Voice:**
- Conversational, not technical
- Confident, not arrogant
- Helpful, not pushy
- Examples:
  - ❌ "Crested Butte is forecasted to receive 14 inches of snow accumulation from 2/10-2/12"
  - ✅ "CB is getting 67% more snow than your local resorts. Here's your $1,746 weekend trip plan."

- "Where to ski. When to go. Done." (Primary)
- "Your ski oracle. Powered by snow."
- "Stop researching. Start shredding."

## 9. Risk Mitigation

### 9.1 Competitive Risks

**Risk:** OpenSnow builds a recommendation engine and copies OnlySnow's core feature

**Mitigation:**
- Move fast: Launch and iterate quickly to build brand loyalty
- Build moat: User behavioral data (tap patterns, preferences) creates personalization advantage
- Focus on integration: OpenSnow is weather-first; OnlySnow is decision-first with trip planning

**Risk:** Epic/Ikon builds in-house storm tracking and trip planning

**Mitigation:**
- Position as multi-pass solution (OnlySnow works across Epic + Ikon + Indy)
- B2B pivot: License OnlySnow's engine to Epic/Ikon as white-label

### 9.2 Adoption Risks

**Risk:** Users don't trust AI recommendations and prefer manual research

**Mitigation:**
- Transparency: Show WHY OnlySnow recommends each resort (data sources, ranking logic)
- Control: Let users override rankings, dismiss alerts, customize thresholds
- Education: Content marketing explaining how recommendations work

**Risk:** Skiers are creatures of habit and always ski their home mountain

**Mitigation:**
- Target "high variance" users first (storm chasers, destination travelers)
- Social proof: Show "X OnlySnow users skied [resort] last weekend" to create FOMO
- Gamification: "You've skied 3 new resorts this season—try 2 more to unlock OnlySnow Explorer badge"

### 9.3 Revenue Risks

**Risk:** Affiliate conversion rates are lower than projected

**Mitigation:**
- Diversify revenue: Premium subscriptions provide baseline, affiliates are upside
- Optimize conversion funnel: A/B test trip planner UI, add urgency ("Flight prices up 15% in 24 hrs")
- Direct partnerships: Negotiate higher commissions with smaller OTAs (e.g., Ski.com vs Expedia)
