# Example: Avon Road Trip Alert

**Scenario**: Chris lives in Avon, CO. Epic pass. Vail gets 10", Beaver Creek gets 8", Crested Butte gets 20".

---

## The Problem

10" at Vail is an excellent day. Most people would stop there. But 20" at Crested Butte — which is also on Epic — is a once-or-twice-a-season event. The product needs to surface that and help plan the trip.

This scenario tests the **road trip threshold** — when conditions somewhere distant are SO much better that it justifies a drive, even when your home resorts are having a good day.

## What the User Sees

### 5 Days Before the Storm

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 📡 HEADS UP — Storm brewing for Tuesday

 Early models showing a big southern-track storm.
 This pattern favors southern CO mountains.

 Your local (Vail/BC):     6-10" likely
 Crested Butte (Epic):    16-22" possible

 CB could see 2x what the Vail Valley gets.
 Keep an eye on this — details still uncertain.
