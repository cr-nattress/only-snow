━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 YOUR WEEKEND SKI OUTLOOK
 Epic Pass · From Denver · Updated Wed Feb 4, 10pm
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 ⚠️  HONEST TAKE: This is a rough year. Colorado
 snowpack is at 55% of normal — a record low for
 23 straight days. But there IS snow coming.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 THIS WEEKEND · Sat Feb 7 - Sun Feb 8
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 Verdict: 🟡 DECENT — Groomer day, no fresh snow

 No snowfall expected through Monday. All resorts
 will be groomed, firm conditions. Sunny skies,
 temps in the low 30s. Not a powder day — but if
 you want to ski, it'll be pleasant.

 │  ✦ Got 6" overnight — best snow on I-70     │
 │    today by a wide margin. 15 min closer     │

 │    real and $89 is hard to beat.             │

 │  ✦ Same snow as Breck, but only 18% open.   │
 │    Skip this one — not enough terrain.       │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

 💡 RECOMMENDATION: This is a tough one.

    ON YOUR PASS: Breckenridge. Most snow (3"),
    most terrain, no extra cost.

    BEST SNOW TODAY: Loveland. 6" — double what
    Breck got. Walk-up is $89 and it's 15 min
    closer to Denver. If you care about the snow
    more than the pass value, Loveland wins today.

    MAXIMIZE YOUR DAY: Keystone. Ski the day,
    grab dinner at River Run, night ski til 8pm.
    Two sessions for one drive.

 NEXT WEEKEND · Sat Feb 14 - Sun Feb 15
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 Verdict: 🟢 DON'T MISS THIS ONE

 ❄️ STORM INCOMING: Tue Feb 10 - Thu Feb 12

 A pattern change is finally arriving. NW flow
 storm could bring significant snow mid-week.
 By Saturday Feb 14, resorts should have fresh
 snow on the ground — the best conditions in
 weeks.

 FORECAST SNOW TOTALS (Tue-Thu storm)

 YOUR RESORTS
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  🥇 Vail            8-12"     1h 40m        │
 │  🥈 Breckenridge    4-8"      1h 30m        │
 │     Keystone        3-6"      1h 30m        │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

 WORTH KNOWING
 ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Beaver Creek       7-10"     1h 50m  Epic  │
 │  ✦ Almost as much as Vail, less crowded     │
 │    on post-storm Saturdays. Same storm       │
 │    pattern (NW flow hits both equally).      │
 │    Not in your saved resorts — should it be? │
 │                                              │
 │  Winter Park        6-9"      1h 30m  Ikon  │
 │  ✦ Mary Jane side could be the sleeper.     │
 │    NW flow hits it too. Not on your pass     │
 │    but walk-up ~$159. Worth it for 9" of     │
 │    Mary Jane bumps if you're an advanced     │
 │    skier.                                    │
 │                                              │
 │  Copper Mountain    5-8"      1h 25m  Ikon  │
 │  ✦ Splits the difference: more snow than    │
 │    Breck, shorter drive than Vail. Walk-up   │
 │    ~$139. Good option if Vail looks mobbed.  │
 └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

 NW flow storms favor Vail Valley and the
 Continental Divide resorts. Summit County
 (Breck, Keystone) typically gets less from
 this storm direction.

 💡 RECOMMENDATION: Vail on Saturday Feb 14
    If the storm delivers, this could be the best
    day of February. Vail's Back Bowls with 8-12"
    of fresh is worth the extra 10 min of drive.
    Leave Denver by 6:30 AM — post-storm
    Saturdays fill the garage by 8:30.

    STEALTH PICK: Beaver Creek. Same storm, same
    snow totals, half the crowds. 10 min past
    Vail. Consider adding it to your resorts.

    BACKUP: If storm shifts south or underperforms,
    Breck is the safer bet (more consistent
    coverage, shorter drive, on your pass).

 TWO-WEEK OUTLOOK · Your Best Days
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 Feb 7-8 (this wknd): 🟡 Groomers, decent
 Feb 14-15 (next wknd): 🟢 Post-storm — go!
 Feb 21-22 (2 wknds out): ❓ Too early to call,
   but models hint at more activity mid-month

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 EXPERT TAKE · Joel Gratz, OpenSnow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 "Sunny and warm from Wednesday through Monday,
  then (finally) the weather pattern will become
  stormier with snow likely. A storm will arrive
  mid/late next week with powder possible around
  Thursday, February 12, but details are
  uncertain."

 Pivotal Weather models show up to 24" possible
 in parts of the state through Feb 18, favoring
 peaks around Vail and Aspen.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 SEASON CONTEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 Colorado snowpack: 55% of normal (record low)
 Vail season total: 90" (estimated)
 Breck season total: ~75"

 This has been one of the driest seasons on
 record. The mid-February storm window is
 critical — if it delivers, conditions improve
 significantly. If it misses, it's going to be
 a long season.

## Why This Works

### What it does that OpenSnow doesn't:

1. **Starts with the USER, not a resort** — "Your resorts from Denver" is the frame
2. **Two layers: Your Resorts + Worth Knowing** — Always shows your saved resorts first, but surfaces nearby opportunities when they're meaningfully better
3. **Answers the weekend question directly** — "This weekend: 🟡 decent. Next weekend: 🟢 don't miss it."
4. **Factors in pass, drive time, and price together** — "Loveland: 6", not on your pass, but $89 and 15 min closer"
5. **Knows storm patterns** — "NW flow favors Vail/Beaver Creek over Summit County"
6. **Gives a specific recommendation PER PRIORITY** — "On your pass: Breck. Best snow: Loveland. Best value: Keystone night ski."
7. **Provides a backup plan** — "If storm underperforms, Breck is the safer bet"
8. **Includes logistics** — "Parking fills by 8:30 AM on post-storm Saturdays"
9. **Proactively recommends resorts you don't track** — "Beaver Creek: same storm, half the crowds. Should it be in your resorts?"
10. **Honest about the season** — "55% snowpack, record low" builds trust
11. **Two-weekend lookahead** — The minimum planning horizon for a weekend-only skier
12. **Only surfaces non-pass resorts when it matters** — Loveland at 6" when your best got 3" = worth knowing. Copper with 1" more than Breck = not worth the noise.
