## 1. Industry-Standard Persona Categories

The ski industry uses overlapping segmentation frameworks from different organizations. No single canonical list exists, but the following categories are well-established across NSAA reports, SIA studies, resort marketing, and academic research.

### By Visit Frequency (Industry-Wide)

| Segment | Days/Season | % of Skier Population | Notes |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|-------|

## 6. Planning Behavior

### Planning Horizon by Persona

| Persona | Planning Window | Decision Trigger | Price Sensitivity |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Season Pass Holder / Local** | 0-3 days | Weekend weather forecast; "is it a powder day?" | Low (already paid for pass) |
| **Day Ticket Buyer / Local** | 1-7 days | Good conditions + available weekend | High; compares ticket prices |
| **Regional Weekender** | 3-14 days | Multi-day forecast; lodging availability | Moderate |
| **Advance Planner (Destination)** | 30-180 days | Vacation scheduling; deals and packages | Moderate; books early for savings |
| **Storm Chaser (Destination)** | 5-10 days | Model convergence on major storm event | Variable; will pay premium for great snow |
| **Group / Family Planner** | 60-180+ days | School breaks; coordinating multiple schedules | High; all-inclusive packages preferred |

### Weather-Dependent Decision Making

Research shows weather is the single most important attribute in ski day decisions:

**Decision factors ranked by importance:**
1. Weather/snow conditions on the day (strongest factor)
2. Lift ticket/pass price
3. Lift queue time / crowding
4. Fraction of slopes open
5. Terrain variety and difficulty
6. Ancillary amenities (dining, lodging)

**Powder Day Chaser Behavior:**
- 10 days out: look for weather pattern, not specific forecast
- 7 days out: targeting narrows to specific regions
- 4-5 days out: high confidence; start booking flights/lodging
- 2-3 days out: commit or abandon; prices spike as forecast firms
- Day-of: "powder fever" drives disproportionate risk-taking and willingness to endure crowding/lines

Professional powder chasers position near strategic locations (e.g., Grand Junction, Idaho Falls) to be within driving distance of multiple major resort regions.

### Information Sources Used

| Source Type | Usage | Skier Profile |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| **Resort website / app** | Trail maps, conditions, webcams, lift status | All levels |
| **OpenSnow** | Expert local forecasts; powder probability | Avid/core skiers; storm chasers |
| **OnTheSnow** | Multi-resort comparison; snow reports; reviews | Destination planners; comparison shoppers |
| **Slopes / Ski Tracks apps** | Personal stats tracking; vertical, speed, runs | Data-oriented; competitive; social |
| **Social media (Instagram, TikTok)** | Conditions photos; influencer content; vibes | Gen Z; social/lifestyle skiers |
| **Word of mouth / friends** | Trusted recommendations; real-time conditions reports | All levels, especially beginners |
| **NOAA / NWS** | Raw weather data; avalanche forecasts | Expert / backcountry skiers |
| **Powderchasers** | 10-day powder forecasts; email storm alerts | Destination storm chasers |
| **Resort email/push notifications** | Deals, conditions updates, events | Pass holders; loyalty program members |

**Digital engagement:** 70% of skiers use websites for vacation research; 50% purchase lift tickets online. Skiers have higher digital engagement than the general traveler population.

### Booking and Purchase Behavior

- Lift ticket/pass price is "by far the most important factor of cost" (Langston Co.)
- Snow/weather conditions (29%) and terrain (24%) are top quality drivers
- Cost has a stronger impact on perceived value than quality overall
- All-inclusive packages particularly appeal to budget-conscious travelers and families
- Gen Z: 72% want websites to anticipate needs; 58% willing to pay premium for personalized experiences
- Mobile: 92% enjoy mobile ordering; 20% increase in purchases via mobile

## Key Takeaways for Product Development

1. **The market is concentrating**: Fewer unique skiers, more visits per skier. Season pass holders drive the business. The industry needs new participants but makes most of its money from core/avid skiers.

2. **Weather is king**: Across all segments, snow/weather conditions are the #1 decision driver. Any product serving skiers must have excellent weather and conditions data at its core.

3. **The pass changed everything**: Epic and Ikon passes restructured how skiers choose where to ski. Pass compatibility is now a primary filter ("is this on my pass?").

4. **Two-scale problem**: Local skiers need hyperlocal data (which run is groomed, which lift is open). Destination skiers need national-scale pattern recognition (where is the snow?). These are fundamentally different information architectures.

5. **Beginners are a leaky bucket**: 81% dropout rate means the industry loses 4 out of 5 first-timers. Products that help beginners navigate the overwhelming complexity of skiing (where to go, what to rent, which runs to try) could improve conversion.

6. **The affluent skew is real**: 67-74% of skier visits come from $100K+ households. The sport is becoming more exclusive, not less. This affects product positioning and monetization strategy.

7. **Gen Z is the gap**: 96.6% of Gen Z has never skied. They have $143B in spending power. They want digital-first, personalized, social experiences. Whoever cracks Gen Z skiing will define the next era of the industry.

8. **Touring is the growth story**: 700K to 2.2M participants in three years. This segment needs different data than resort skiers (avalanche, snowpack, wind, route conditions).

9. **Women are underrepresented**: 38% of visits despite being 50%+ of population. Female participation is growing while male is declining. Products that feel welcoming and inclusive to women (not "extreme bro" coded) have a larger addressable market.

10. **The destination trip is the highest-value transaction**: A single destination ski trip generates $1,000-3,000 in economic activity. Products that help plan and optimize these trips capture the most valuable moments in a skier's season.
