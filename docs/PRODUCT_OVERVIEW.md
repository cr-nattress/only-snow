# OnlySnow — Product Overview

**Where to ski and when.**

---

## What Is OnlySnow?

OnlySnow is a ski decision engine. It monitors every resort within your drive radius and tells you where to ski and when — based on your pass, your location, your schedule, and the weather.

Most ski apps are resort-first. You pick Vail, then check the forecast. OnlySnow is the opposite: it's region-first. You tell us where you live, and we tell you which resort has the best snow right now.

**One question, answered daily: "Where's the best snow I can reach?"**

---

## Who Is It For?

OnlySnow serves nine types of skiers. During signup, the app asks a series of questions and classifies each user into one of these profiles:

| Type | Who They Are | What OnlySnow Does for Them |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Core Local** | 20+ days a season, chases every storm | Dawn patrol alerts at 5:30 AM, terrain-specific reports |
| **Storm Chaser** | Will fly anywhere for deep powder | National storm tracking, flight prices, destination planning |
| **Family Planner** | Makes ski days work for the whole family | Grooming reports, crowd forecasts, lesson availability |
| **Weekend Warrior** | Limited to weekends, maximizes each one | Thursday evening outlooks, best-value picks |
| **Resort Loyalist** | Has a home mountain, just needs timing | Deep single-resort intel, optimal day predictions |
| **Learning Curve** | Building skills and confidence | Beginner-friendly resort picks, ideal learning conditions |
| **Social Skier** | Skiing is about the group and the experience | Event alerts, group coordination, apres-ski scene |
| **Luxury Seeker** | Quality over quantity | Premium resort picks, VIP access, best-in-class conditions |
| **Budget Maximizer** | Gets the most skiing per dollar | Deal alerts, pass value analysis, discount day tracking |

Every piece of information the app shows — rankings, alerts, language, timing — adapts to the user's type.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Tell Us About You (Onboarding)

New users answer 8-10 quick questions:

1. **Where do you live?** — City or ZIP code
2. **What pass do you have?** — Epic, Ikon, Indy, Multiple, or None
3. **How far will you drive?** — 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours
4. **How often do you ski?** — Casual (0-5 days), Regular (6-15), Core (16-30), Lifestyle (30+)
5. **Who do you ski with?** — Solo, Partner, Family with kids, or Friends
6. **How old are your kids?** — (Only if family is selected) Under 5, 5-10, 11-15, 16+
7. **Will you travel for a big storm?** — Anywhere, Within driving, or No
8. **What makes you decide to ski?** — Fresh snow, Weekend free, Trip planned, Good deal
9. **How would you describe your skiing?** — Beginner through Expert

The app then classifies you into a skier type and shows a personality-test-style reveal: *"You're a Storm Chaser 🌨️ — you'll travel anywhere when a big storm hits."* Users can accept or choose a different type.

The flow is adaptive. Families get asked about kid ages. Users without a pass skip the storm travel question. Nothing feels wasted.

### Step 2: Your Dashboard (The Daily Decision)

The dashboard answers one question: **Where should I ski?**

It shows three things:

**Your Resorts** — A ranked list of every resort on your pass within your drive radius, sorted by who has the best snow right now. Each resort shows:
- How much snow fell in the last 24 hours
- How much is forecast over the next 5 or 10 days
- Current base depth
- How much terrain is open
- How far the drive is

The ranking changes based on conditions. On a normal day, resorts are sorted by terrain and drive time. On a powder day, the resort with the most overnight snow jumps to the top.

**Worth Knowing** — Appears only when a resort NOT on your pass has significantly better conditions than your best option. Example: *"Loveland got 6 inches — 2x your resorts. Not on your Epic pass, but $89 walk-up and 15 minutes closer than Breck."* This section only shows up when it's genuinely worth knowing. On most days, it's hidden.

**Storm Tracker** — A persistent bar at the bottom of the dashboard showing incoming weather. It has four states:
- **Quiet:** "Nothing major in the next 10 days." (Gray, minimal)
- **Something Brewing:** "8-14 inches expected in CO Feb 10-12." (Yellow)
- **Significant:** "18 inches hitting Summit County." (Orange)
- **Chase-Worthy:** "Telluride: 24-36 inches next week. Flights from $289." (Red, with trip planning link)

### Step 3: The Map

An interactive map shows all your resorts with color-coded markers. Bigger snow totals get darker markers. Your home location appears as a pin with a circle showing your drive radius. You can pan and zoom to explore.

### Step 4: Resort Details

Tap any resort to see its full profile:
- A 10-day forecast chart showing daily snowfall, temperatures, and weather icons
- Current conditions: lifts open, trails open, base depth, grooming status
- Pass type and drive time
- Webcam links

### Step 5: Storm Chase (for Travelers)

The Chase page shows a national view of where the snow is going over the next 10 days. Every ski region in the country is displayed as a card, color-coded by storm severity:
- Quiet (gray)
- Moderate (yellow)
- Significant (orange)
- Major Event (red)

Tap any region to drill in and see resort-level detail: which resort is getting the most snow, what pass it's on, and current conditions. For major events, the app can estimate trip costs including flights, lodging, and rental cars.

Regions are sorted by severity first, then by distance from you. If you live in Denver and a massive storm is hitting Utah, it shows up near the top — but a local Colorado storm will always rank higher at the same severity.

### Step 6: Smart Alerts

OnlySnow sends a maximum of two notifications per day. Never more. Every alert must be actionable — if there's nothing to act on, the app stays quiet.

**Six notification types:**

1. **Powder Alert** — Your resort got 6+ inches overnight. Sent at dawn. *"Vail got 8 inches overnight. Back Bowls are loaded. Leave by 6:30 AM — garage fills by 8:30."*

2. **Storm Incoming** — 9+ inches forecast at your resort in 3-7 days. *"9-12 inches hitting Breck Tuesday. NW flow storm. Best day: Wednesday Feb 12."*

3. **Weekend Outlook** — Sent once per week, Thursday evening. *"This weekend: Breck is your best bet. 64% terrain open. No new snow expected. Keystone has night skiing Fri-Sat."*

4. **Chase Alert** — 18+ inches at a destination resort on your pass. Escalates over time:
   - 7-10 days out: *"Models showing potential storm. No action needed."*
   - 5-6 days out: *"Storm firming up. Check flight prices now."*
   - 3-4 days out: *"Forecast locked in. Book now — flights are rising."*
   - 1-2 days out: *"Storm arriving. If you booked, you're set."*

5. **Worth Knowing** — A nearby resort not on your pass has dramatically better snow. *"Loveland got 6 inches — 2x your resorts. $89 walk-up, 15 min closer than Breck."*

6. **Price Drop** — Flight prices decreased for a storm trip you looked at. *"Montrose flights dropped to $249. Down $40 from yesterday. 3 seats left."*

Alerts are personalized by skier type. Core Locals get powder alerts at 5:30 AM for dawn patrol. Family Planners get weekend outlooks with lesson info and crowd forecasts. Storm Chasers get national storm tracking with flight prices. Budget Maximizers get deal alerts.

## What Makes It Different

### Compared to OpenSnow
OpenSnow is a weather app for ski resorts. You pick a resort, then check its forecast. OnlySnow flips this: you tell us your constraints (location, pass, drive time), and we tell you which resort wins today. OpenSnow answers *"What's the weather at Vail?"* — OnlySnow answers *"Should I go to Vail, Breck, or Keystone?"*

### Compared to resort apps
Resort apps show conditions for one mountain. OnlySnow compares every mountain you can reach and ranks them against each other. It also surfaces resorts you weren't considering.

### Compared to generic weather apps
Weather apps show weather. OnlySnow shows decisions. It knows your pass, your drive time, your kids' ages, and your travel willingness. It turns raw forecast data into *"Leave by 5 AM, drive to Breck, ski Peak 6."*

## The Data Behind It

OnlySnow aggregates data from multiple sources to power its recommendations:

- **Snow forecasts** — Updated daily, covering 10-day windows for every resort
- **Current conditions** — Base depth, lifts open, trails open, grooming status; updated every 6 hours
- **SNOTEL stations** — Snow water equivalent measurements from government sensors near ski areas
- **Avalanche zones** — Backcountry avalanche danger ratings from regional forecast centers
- **Road conditions** — Highway status for major ski corridors (I-70, US-40, etc.)
- **Drive times** — Calculated from user's home to each resort
- **Flight prices** — For storm chase destinations (when applicable)

All of this is processed into a simple ranked list and plain-English recommendations. Users never see raw data — they see answers.

## AI-Powered Analysis

OnlySnow uses AI to generate natural-language analysis that reads like advice from a local who knows your situation:

> *"Breckenridge is your best bet this week. A northwest flow storm drops 12-16 inches Tuesday night through Wednesday. Peak 6 and the back bowls will be untracked Wednesday morning. Keystone gets less from this storm angle — stick to Breck. Thursday is the powder day. Friday is groomer day."*

This analysis is personalized. A family planner for the same storm might see:

> *"Good weekend setup at Breck. Storm clears Thursday, groomers will be perfect Saturday. Kids' group lessons available at 10 AM. Avoid Sunday — holiday weekend crowds."*

## Design Philosophy

**1. Never cry wolf.** If there's no snow, the app stays quiet. No filler content, no "conditions are fair" alerts. When OnlySnow notifies you, it means something.

**2. Answer, don't inform.** Every screen answers a question. The dashboard answers "where should I ski?" The chase page answers "where's the biggest storm?" The alerts answer "do I need to act right now?" Raw data is always translated into a recommendation.

**3. Respect the 5 AM decision.** Most ski day decisions happen before sunrise. The app is built for bleary-eyed, one-thumb scrolling. Big numbers, clear rankings, obvious winners. No scrolling through paragraphs to find the answer.

**4. Your pass matters.** Knowing a non-pass resort got more snow is useful context, but leading with it would be cruel. OnlySnow always leads with your pass resorts, and only surfaces off-pass options when the difference is dramatic.

**5. Two alerts per day, max.** Notification fatigue kills apps. OnlySnow enforces a hard limit and scores every potential alert by urgency, relevance, and recency before choosing which two to send.
